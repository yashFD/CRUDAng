How Client Side Caching Works ?
In our Proj the http interceptor captures all requests to the server

In 1st request interceptor will save data from GET request in client side application storage

Application storage is a temporary storage used for storing small amount of data on client browser

if we request that same page again we will cached response and request not will hit server

In case we modify the data then interceptor will remove that cache and request the server for data changes

this is the flow of client side caching in angular
